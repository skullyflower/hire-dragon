              I&apos;m a front-end software engineer, specializing in ReactJS, who enjoys writing
              original code, and creating solutions to those problems that haven&apos;t been solved
              yet.
            </p>
            {textExpanded && (
              <>
                <p>
                  I&apos;ve been working remotely for over a decade. The front-end is my jam, but I
                  am full-stack capable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am a natural. My friends and I all got into web creation at the same time in the
                  late 90&apos;s, but I am the only one still writing code. From the very start of
                  my career, I&apos;ve been learning new languages and techniques. My first job
                  started building static HTML pages out of images in tables, but I quickly learned
                  how to create reusable, data driven, PHP templates and alleviate the repetitious
                  work of creating the same document over and over.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since then I&apos;ve built sites and apps with various iterations of php and .net,
                  Javascript, created custom frameworks and systems, refactored and reskinned, and
                  used many more. Through the years I&apos;ve built up my CSS, Javascript, REST, and
                  Object Oriented coding pattern knowledge and skill. But the landscape is always
                  changing, and there is always something new to learn. In the last 6 or so years
                  I&apos;ve really fallen in love with REACT. It&apos;s a joy to work in, and makes
                  it easy to keep concerns separate, reuse and organize code.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every time I learn something particularly interesting or useful, my site
                  skullyflower.com gets refactored to use it. Although I do my development work
                  primarily in NodeJs these days, my personal computer still has an apache web
                  server running on it as a staging environment for my personal projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I&apos;m a practical engineer. I&apos;ve always got the purpose, connected
                  systems, and the end users of what I&apos;m working on in mind. It makes me better
                  at communicating technical subjects to non engineers than some.

                <p>When I can, I draw monsters and comics. I also occasionally paint.</p>
