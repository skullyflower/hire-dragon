              I&apos;ve been learning and applying new languages and methodologies since my first
              tech gig. I barely knew HTML before I had to start scripting in PHP. The next job
              required Javascript which is a very different language from PHP.
            </p>

                  I have finally abandoned the impostor syndrome. I&apos;ve proven I can learn
                  anything and apply it in a professional setting, rather quickly. I ask questions,
                  look things up, and ask for help, instead of becoming scared or defensive when
                  asked to do something outside my comfort zone.

                  When I started at UniteU, I&apos;d never used a Windows computer (I was Mac/ unix)
                  was insecure about my Javascript knowledge, and had never even heard of C# or
                  asp.net, but was quickly up and running in it all, and soon became the dev most
                  requested by the pickiest clients.
                </p>

                  Then at Homepoint I got the opportunity to start building with React and have come
                  into myself. I love the way React lends itself to clean, organized reusable code.
                  (Not that you cannot make a mess of it.) I wonder where my next position will
                  bring me? Ruby on Rails perhaps?

            onClick={() => setTextExpaned(!textExpanded)}
          >
            {textExpanded ? '... Show less' : 'Show more ...'}
