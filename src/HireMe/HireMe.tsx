              I&apos;m a front-end software engineer specializing in ReactJS, who enjoys writing
              original code, creating solutions to those problems that haven&apos;t been solved yet.
            </p>

                <p>
                  I&apos;ve been working remotely for over a decade. I specialize in front-end, but
                  am fullstack capable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the very start of my career, I&apos;ve been learning new languages and
                  techniques. My first job started building static pages with images in tables, with
                  some mouseover effects, but quickly became creating reusable, data driven, PHP
                  templates.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since then I&apos;ve built sites and apps with various iterations of php and .net,
                  Javascript, created custom frameworks and systems, refactored and reskinned, and
                  used many more. Through the years I&apos;ve built up my CSS, Javascript, REST, and
                  Object Oriented coding pattern knowledge and skill. But the lanscape is always
                  changing, and there is always something new to learn. Every time I learn something
                  particularly interesting or useful, my site skullyflower.com gets refactored to
                  use it. My personal computer always has an apache web server running on it as a
                  staging environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the last 6 or so years I&apos;ve really fallen in love with REACT. It&apos;s a
                  joy to work in and is, by design, easy to keep concerns separate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I&apos;m a practical engineer. I&apos;ve always got the purpose, connected
                  systems, and the end users of the code in mind. It&apos;s why I&apos;m better at
                  talking to non engineers about technical subjects than some.
