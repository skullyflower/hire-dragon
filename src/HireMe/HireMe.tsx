            <p>
              I&apos;m passionate about bringing excellent designs to life with real data. I work
              well within cross functional teams, boldly and tenaciously meeting the challenges of
              good UX design, difficult to realize requirements, or complex data manipulations. I
              have experience creating fully responsive sites from scratch with pure css, but am
              also comfortable working with UI frameworks, like Chakra or Bootstrap. I have a record
              of delighting impossible to please clients, and other stakeholders.

                  In recent years, my career has brought me into the mortgage industry,
                  creating/expanding/maintaining mortgage portal, SaaS apps. Although the challenges
                  these sites pose are juicy, my creative side is dying, and I am looking to make a
                  change back to more visually interesting and client centered challenges.

                  I myself am no designer - I&apos;m more of a weird artist. However, I work well
                  with excellent designers. I am able to not only replicate a static design, but
                  also turn it into a dynamic, living piece of code, that responds to the screen on
                  which it is displayed, and to variations in the data, that it will contain.
