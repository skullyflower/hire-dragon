                  My passion is bringing excellent designs to life with real data. I work well with
                  in cross functional teams, boldly and tenaciously meeting the challenges of good
                  UX design or complex data manipulations. I have experience creating fully
                  responsive sites from scratch in pure css and html, and also with the aid of UI
                  frameworks. I have a record of delighting impossible to please clients.

                <p>
                  A child of chaotic circumstances, I&apos;m the first in my family to have a
                  professional career. I enjoy the quiet control of being able to make functioning
                  machines out of typed script. When I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;m creating
                  creatures and worlds in ink and paper. Socially, I&apos;m compassionate and
                  supportive, but also quick to laugh and joke around.

                  Professionally, I have finally abandoned the impostor syndrome. I&apos;ve proven I
                  can learn anything and apply it in a professional setting, rather quickly. I ask
                  questions, look things up, and ask for help.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I&apos;ve been learning and applying new languages and methodologies since my
                  first tech gig. I barely knew HTML before I had to start scripting in PHP. The
                  next job required Javascript which is a very different language from PHP. Since
                  then I&apos;ve worked in C#, angularJs, JQuery, and other languages and
                  frameworks, up and down the stack.

                  Then at Homepoint I had the opportunity to start building with React and have come
                  to love the way React lends itself to clean, organized reusable code. (Not that
                  you cannot make a mess of it.){' '}
