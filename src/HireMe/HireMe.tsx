              I have finally abandoned the impostor syndrome. I can learn anything and can apply
              what I learn in a professional setting, rather quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              I&apos;ve been learning and applying new languages and methodologies since my first
              tech gig. I barely knew HTML before I had to start scripting in PHP. The next job
              required Javascript which is a very different language from PHP.

                  When I started at Unite, I&apos;d never used a Windows computer (I was Mac/ unix)
                  was insecure about my Javascript knowledge, and had never even heard of C# or
                  asp.net, but was quickly up and running in it all, and soon became the dev most
                  requested by the pickiest clients.

                  Then at Homepoint I got the opportunity to get into React and have come into
                  myself. I love the way React lends itself to clean, organized reusable code. Not
                  that you cannot make a mess of it. I wonder where my next position will bring me?
                  Ruby on Rails perhaps?
                </p>
                <p>
                  I used to become so scared and defensive when asked to do something outside my
                  comfort zone. Now I&apos;ve learned to ask questions, look things up, and ask for
                  help.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I love to share knowledge. I write decent documentation. I&apos;m still a little
                  shy and have a difficult time posting my writing and ideas into the world at
                  large, but in the context of a company, where there is a general agreement or
                  I&apos;ve been assigned as the expert, I&apos;ll keep records and make sure that
                  others understand what they need to know.
