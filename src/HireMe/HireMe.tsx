                  My passion is bringing excellent designs to life with real data. I work well with
                  in cross functional teams, boldly and tenaciously meeting the challenges of good
                  UX design or complex data manipulations. I have experience creating fully
                  responsive sites from scratch in pure css, but also with the aid of UI frameworks,
                  like Bootstrap. I have a record of delighting impossible to please clients.

                  <b>Socially</b>, I&apos;m compassionate and supportive, but also quick to laugh
                  and joke around. <b>Professionally</b>, I have finally abandoned the impostor
                  syndrome. I&apos;ve proven I can learn anything and apply it in a professional
                  setting, rather quickly. I ask questions, look things up, and ask for help.
                  I&apos;m also quick to jump in if I feel I can help.

                  I&apos;ve been learning and applying new languages and methodologies since my
                  first tech gig. I barely knew HTML before I had to start scripting in PHP. The
                  next job required Javascript which is a very different language from PHP. Since
                  then I&apos;ve worked in C#, angularJs, JQuery, and other languages and
                  frameworks, up and down the stack.

                  Then at Homepoint I had the opportunity to start building with React and have come
                  to love the way React lends itself to clean, organized reusable code. (Not that
                  you cannot make a mess of it.){' '}
